# cs100-project
Project for cs100 
> This project is created using SFML, a C++ GUI library. 
> For this project, we implemented three design patterns
  1. Composite (Menu System)
  2. Abstract Factory (Enemy creation) 
  3. Mediator (Control the speed of the Enemy) 
  
 In order to run this project, open it in an IDE and press Command Shift B and choose the Build & Run: Debug 
 
The point of this game is to get the highest score possible. Enemies will be coming from the top of the window and your goal is to click on the enemy before it reaches the bottom. You have 20 health and if you get to 0 health you lose the game.
